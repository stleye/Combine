# Combine

- Publishers transmit a sequence of values over time to one or more subscribers, either synchronously or asynchronously.
- A subscriber can subscribe to a publisher to receive values; however, the subscriber’s input and failure types must match the publisher’s output and failure types.
- There are two built-in operators you can use to subscribe to publishers: `sink(_:_:)` and `assign(to:on:)`.
- A subscriber may increase the demand for values each time it receives a value, but it cannot decrease demand.
- To free up resources and prevent unwanted side effects, cancel each subscription when you’re done.
- You can also store a subscription in an instance or collection of `AnyCancellable` to receive automatic cancelation upon deinitialization.
- A future can be used to receive a single value asynchronously at a later time.
- Subjects are publishers that enable outside callers to send multiple values asynchronously to subscribers, with or without a starting value.
- Type erasure prevents callers from being able to access additional details of the underlying type.
- Use the `print()` operator to log all publishing events to the console and see what’s going on.
